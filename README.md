# pyshare

pyshare allows to share directories to your local network from your terminal.

![demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50829834/205405582-8da824e4-2bac-4b02-ba4c-965d3d3e8fed.png)

This is basically a copy of [parvardegr/sharing](https://github.com/parvardegr/sharing), but written in Python. Also, it's less advanced. I kept it as simple as possible.

## Installation

```sh
pip install pyshare
```

## Usage

```sh
pyshare <directory_path>
```

Use `pyshare -h` for more details.
